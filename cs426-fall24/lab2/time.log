The Kubernetes commands confused me at the beginning, especially when referencing
the different services and pods. I also spent considerable time for properly adding
the client pool feature, round-robin logic, and adjusting the connection logic of part
C. This led to several redeployments and testing, which was time-consuming. Moreover,
I was not familiar with YAML files before and, thus, I had to spend time getting familiar
with them by reading the specs/other relevant resources. Additionally, I did not know
how UUIDs work and how they guarantee universal uniqueness and, thus, spent some time
researching to provide a complete answer for this discussions question.
