Some challenges that I faced included getting familiar/becoming more fluent
with the Go language. Also, I was initially challenged for coming up with edge
cases for tests and making sure implementations are correct, e.g. for the
MergeChannelsOrCancel function, for which I was unsure about its behavior
when data is successfully read by a channel but we cancel before it is written
to the out channel.
