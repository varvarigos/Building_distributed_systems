Some challenges that I faced included getting familiar with and becoming more fluent
in programming in Go and concurrent programming. This also included understanding the 
language to be able to answer the written questions correctly. Moreover, it took me some time
until I had learnt to constract correct and running tests. Also, I was initially
challenged for coming up with interesting edge cases for tests and subsequently making
sure my implementations were correct (debugging). Specifically, for the MergeChannelsOrCancel
function I was unsure about its behavior when data is successfully read by a channel but we
cancel before it is written to the out channel.
