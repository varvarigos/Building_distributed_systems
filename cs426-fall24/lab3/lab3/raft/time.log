Getting familiar with the raft algorithm and understanding the details of the raft paper took me 
significant time. Debugging for part A was particularly time-consuming, and required me to go back and forth
multiple times and carefully re-read the raft paper and re-order my code. The discussions of part A also
required research and some extra time, which I had not anticipated. For TestBasicAgree3B, I encountered
`one(100) failed to reach agreement` error. Debugging this issue was challenging for me as it was not due to a
single error, and took me several hours before I had resolved it. The rest of Part B took me a significant time
as well to complete. I was especially stuck on TestBackup3B, eventually used `rf.hasCommittedChan` to notify the
leader. Finally, although part C1 was easy to implement, for part C2 I was occasionally failing the TestFigure83C,
and also the TestFigure8Unreliable3C due to taking too long.
