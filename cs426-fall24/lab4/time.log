One part that took me some time was handling errors in Part B3, where I kept failing tests because I mistakenly
returned an error message even when there was no actual error. Another challenge was getting concurrent `Set`
operations to run for multiple nodes in Part B4, where I encountered race conditions that required careful
synchronization to ensure errors were handled properly without interrupting other requests. Implementing
`handleShardMapUpdate` was also difficult, as I struggled to get shards to update consistently, with some shards
not being added or removed correctly. Additionally, the discussion in Part D took a significant amount of time as
I worked to devise meaningful experiments to test the system.
