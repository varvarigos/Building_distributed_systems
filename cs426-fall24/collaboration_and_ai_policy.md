# Collaboration and AI Policy

## General Statement on Collaboration
TL;DR: Same as [CS323](https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs323/current/syllabus.html) for the individual labs (Labs 0-3).

Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process in which you must reach your own understanding of the problem and discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with others (including members of the teaching staff) are encouraged. But see the Gilligan's Island Rule below.

However, when the time comes to design the program and write the code, such discussions are no longer appropriate---your solution must be your own personal inspiration (although you may ask members of the teaching staff for help in understanding, designing, writing, and debugging).

Since code reuse is an important part of programming, you may study and/or incorporate published code (e.g., from text books or the Net) in your programs, provided that you give proper attribution in your source code and in your log file and that the bulk of the code submitted is your own. Note: Removing/rewriting comments, renaming functions/variables, or reformatting statements does not convey ownership.

But when you incorporate more than 25 lines of code from a single source, this code (prefaced by a comment identifying the source) must be isolated in a separate file that the rest of your code #include-s or links with. The initial submission of this file should contain only the identifying comment and the original code; revisions may only change types or function/variable names, turn blocks of code into functions, or add comments.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COPY SOMEONE ELSE'S CODE OR GIVE A COPY OF YOUR CODE TO SOMEONE ELSE OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE---to do so is a clear violation of ethical/academic standards that, when discovered, will be referred to the Executive Committee of Yale College for disciplinary action. Modifying code to conceal copying only compounds the offense.

## The Gilligan's Island Rule

When discussing an assignment with anyone other than a member of the teaching staff, you may write on a board or a piece of paper, but you may not keep any written or electronic record of the discussion. Moreover, you must engage in some mind-numbing activity (e.g., watching an episode of Gilligan's Island) before you work on the assignment again. This will ensure that you can reconstruct what you learned, by yourself, using your own brain. The same rule applies to reading books or studying on-line sources.

## AI Policy

We encourage using state-of-the-art tools (including AI ones) as we hope to train top-notch computer scientists and engineers.

We believe the software development has drastically changed and will continue to evolve with the emergence of GenAI. These tools include the AI agents like ChatGPT by OpenAI or Claude by Anthopic, coding copilots like GitHub Copilot or SuperMaven, and other AI-assistance such as autocompletion in IDEs like Visual Studio Code or UI generation tool V0 by Vercel. We want you to witness and experience these early waves or iterations of these products and all their pros and cons.

Treat AI agents and copilots as you would treat a human tutor or a friend. The above collaboration policy and the Gilligan's Island Rule apply as well. You should also be aware that the suggestions they provide may not always be correct (such is also true for your classmates or the teaching staff). You should be able to debug and/or reproduce any code snippet the AI agents provide.

We acknowledge there is a gray area where the help from AI borderlines "too much", we remind you that how much you get out of the course is largely dependent on you and your choices.

Examples:
- Copy pasting questions from the lab directly to ChatGPT and submitting its answers: no.
- Using ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas for a project: yes.
- Asking Claude to write a function for you: no.
- ChatGPT spit out a code snippet for the lab unprompted: apply Gilligan's Island Rule.
- Asking Claude a question about a particular compilation error and suggestions for debugging: yes.
- GitHub Copilot and/or AI-assisted autocompletion generated a block of code (e.g., 10+ lines or a self-contained function): apply Gilligan's Island Rule.
- Using V0 to generate the UI: yes (since the focus of this course is not on UI).
- For your final project, you may use any/all AI tools with proper citation and acknowledgment.

Note on accessibility: most of these tools have a free trial of sorts, if there is a particular tool you would like to try that is not free, please contact the teaching staff to see whether it would be possible to obtain it for the class.
