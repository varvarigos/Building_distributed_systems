----  -------  ----  --------------
9/19  3:00pm   3:00  read the assignment, started with part A, and
                     tested my implementation (part A6).
9/21  12:00pm  3:00  wrote tests for part A, made corrections according to
                     them and implemented batching. Also, did part B, i.e.,
                     implemented/tested GetStats (part B2).
9/22  12:00pm  3:30  started with part C, implemented retry (part C1) and wrote
                     fallback code but had issues.
9/23  4:00pm   3:00  finished part C, wrote tests for it, and corrected accordingly.
9/24  12:30pm  3:00  wrote the discussions for part A, B, and C and finalized.

Some challenges I faced was not handling stats updates properly. Debugging issues related
to stats tracking, was time-consuming and confusing (e.g. implementation decisions such as
whether to count a fallback as an error or not). Also, implementing test cases for fallback
and error handling was especially time-consuming as I had to debug my implementation at the
same time. Additionally, implementing fallback was also challenging and required multiple
attempts to get it right and see the expected stats updates. Finally, as I left most of the
discussions for the end, I had to go back and forth between my implementation and rerun the
code which was time-consuming.
